# MTA Project

* **Goal:** 
  * Determining the best subway station locations to best promote a women in tech event through direct canvassing
* **Data used:**
  * MTA turnstile data
  * NOAA NYC Weather data
* **Target variables:**
  * Daily total exits and entries at turnstiles, subway booths and stations
* **Tools used include:**
  * Pandas
  * Requests
  * json
  * numpy 
  * datetime
  * seaborn
  * google maps
* **Possible impact:**
  * The top 10 stations carry a disproportionate amount of daily traffic (at least 4x average) -> focus on these stations
  * The pandemic caused a steep drop in subway usage around 3/15/2020 and has slowly rebounded throughout the year -> try to hold canvassing off as late as possible to be most effective
  * Weekdays see significantly more traffic than weekends with no discernible difference between weekdays -> send canvassers on weekdays
  * Weather appears to have not impact on traffic -> don't worry about sending canvassers out on hot days, cold days, or rainy days
* **Group:**
  * Andrew Smith, Sean Salem, Garreth Cline, Carla Moestafa
